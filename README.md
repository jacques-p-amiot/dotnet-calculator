# What I'm hoping to achieve with this repo
A dotnet application hooked up to a full CICD pipeline.

## The dotnet application
I'll make a simple calculator class library which will be consumed by a console application which gathers and manages user input. Project structure:
-- calculator app soln
    |
    |--- class library
    |--- unit testing class library
    |--- console application (consumes class library)
